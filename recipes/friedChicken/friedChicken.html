    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
